For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)


Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
crime_scene <- crime_scene_report |>
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |>
  filter(city == "SQL City",
         date == ymd("20180115"),
         type == "murder")

print(crime_scene)

```

```{r}
#| label: Witness-Interviews
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
witnesses <- person %>%
  filter(
    (address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr" & address_number == max(address_number[address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr"])) |
      (address_street_name == "Franklin Ave" & str_detect(name, "^Annabel"))
  )

print(witnesses)


```



```{r}
#| label: potential-suspects
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
witness_interviews <- interview %>%
  filter(person_id %in% witnesses$id) %>%
  left_join(witnesses, by = c("person_id" = "id"))

print(witness_interviews)


```
```{r}


#| label:Gym-Tag-Clue
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
suspect <- get_fit_now_member %>%
  filter(str_starts(id, "48Z"), membership_status == "gold") %>%
  inner_join(get_fit_now_check_in, by = c("id" = "membership_id")) %>%
  filter(check_in_date == 20180109) %>%
  inner_join(person, by = c("person_id" = "id")) %>%
  inner_join(drivers_license, by = c("license_id" = "id")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(plate_number, "H42W"))

print(suspect)

```

```{r}
#| label: Jeremy-Bowers-Interview
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
suspect_interview <- interview %>%
  filter(person_id == suspect$person_id)

print(suspect_interview)

```

```{r}
#| label: Woman-with-Tesla
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
mastermind <- person %>%
  inner_join(drivers_license, by = c("license_id" = "id")) %>%
  inner_join(facebook_event_checkin, by = c("id" = "person_id")) %>%
  filter(
    gender == "female",
    hair_color == "red",
    car_make == "Tesla",
    car_model == "Model S",
    event_name == "SQL Symphony Concert",
    between(date, 20171201, 20171231)
  ) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(attendance = n()) %>%
  filter(attendance == 3)

print(mastermind)



```

**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!



## And the final suspect is...
**The suspect is Miranda Priestly.**

*Put the name of the person responsible for the murder here:*
